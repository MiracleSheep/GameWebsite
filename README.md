### Description

> I decided to make a small flappy bird game but in a different theme so I could practice javascript. [Here](https://miraclesheep.github.io/Javascript_FlappyBirdRippoff/) is the link.
### How to play

> This is just like a regular flappy bird game. Press The up arrow to go up, and try to go through the gap in the moving pillars.
if you touch the ceiling,floor, or the pillars you die.
